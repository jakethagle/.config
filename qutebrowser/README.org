* Pywal Qutebrowser Theme
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: pywal-qutebrowser-theme
  :END:

A theme for [[https://qutebrowser.org][Qutebrowser]] using
[[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][Pywal]] colorschemes shamelessly ripped
off from
[[https://github.com/Linuus/nord-qutebrowser/blob/master/nord-qutebrowser.py][nord-qutebrowser]].

** Dynamic Loading
Dynamic loading depends on =inotify-simple=, =psutil=, and =python-prctl=. You
need to make sure they are on your =$PATH=. You can do this in one of 4 ways:
1. Install the packages using your distro's package manager
2. Run =pip install --user -r requirements.txt= inside the repo folder and add
   =~/.local/bin= to your =$PATH= in your shell of choice:
   + [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26047/how-to-correctly-add-a-path-to-path][bash]]
   + [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11530090/adding-a-new-entry-to-the-path-variable-in-zsh][zsh]]
     (second answer)
   + [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7064053/add-a-relative-path-to-path-on-fish-startup][fish]]
3. Run =pipenv install= inside the repo folder and add the generated virtual
   environments to your =$PATH= as shown above.
4. NOTE: *NOT RECOMMENDED*. Run =sudo pip install -r requirements.txt= inside
   the repo folder.

Finally, either set the variable =qutewal_dynamic_loading= to =True= inside
=qutewal.py=, or export the environment variable =QUTEWAL_DYNAMIC_LOADING= as
=True= using your shell of choice *at login*:
   + bash/zsh :: =export QUTEWAL_DYNAMIC_LOADING=True=
   + fish :: =set -Ux QUTEWAL_DYNAMIC_LOADING True=
